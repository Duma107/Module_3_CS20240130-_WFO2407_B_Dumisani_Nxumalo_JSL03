## Project Overview

This project explores two distinct programming paradigms: **Declarative** and **Imperative**. Using the example of cooking a steak, the project demonstrates how both paradigms approach the same task with different methodologiesâ€”**control flow**, **state management**, and **execution style**.

## Declarative Approach

In the **declarative approach**, the focus is on describing the desired outcome without specifying every detailed step of how to achieve it. The steps in the cooking process, such as preheating the grill and seasoning the steak, are clearly defined, but the actual implementation is abstracted away.

### Key Features:
- **Implicit Coercion**: The language handles data type conversions without explicit instructions.
- **Action Descriptions**: Each action in the process is described, such as preheating or seasoning.
- **High-Level Abstraction**: The focus is on **what** needs to happen rather than the technical details.
- **Declarative Execution**: The process outlines **what** needs to be done at each stage without specifying the details of how to perform it.

## Imperative Approach

In the **imperative approach**, every step in the process is explicitly defined and controlled. This approach ensures that each action, such as preheating, seasoning, or cooking the steak, is performed in a precise sequence, with direct manipulation of state throughout the process.

### Key Features:
- **Explicit Coercion**: The code controls the flow of operations and data conversion.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Each action is carried out in a clear, specified order.
- **State Modification**: Variables are modified throughout the process to track progress, such as the grill or steak temperature.
- **Decision-Making with Conditionals**: The code uses explicit conditions to make decisions, like whether the steak is done or not.

## Usage

To run the examples, copy the code into a JavaScript environment, such as a browser's Developer Console or a Node.js environment. The cooking process will be logged, illustrating how each paradigm handles the task differently.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the differences between **declarative** and **imperative** programming:

- The **declarative approach** emphasizes **what** needs to be done, making it more abstract and easier to manage in some contexts.
- The **imperative approach** provides precise control over **how** tasks are executed, with detailed instructions at every step.

Understanding both approaches allows developers to choose the appropriate style based on the specific problem they are solving.
